Created a unique validation run ID: run_20251017_113232_cxp_ptg_adapter_prod_analysis_1760715148\n2. Executed the 2-agent file-based pipeline:\n   - Config Collector: Successfully generated context_bundle.json\n   - Diff Engine: Successfully generated enhanced_analysis.json\n3. Aggregated results from both agents\n4. Formatted a comprehensive validation report with:\n   - Clear verdict: BLOCK\n   - Summary of drift findings: 1 file with drift, 5 total deltas\n   - Policy violations: 5 high violations\n   - Risk assessment: Critical risk level\n   - Recommendations: Included in the report\n5. The validation report was automatically saved to file: config_data/reports/run_20251017_113232_cxp_ptg_adapter_prod_analysis_1760715148_report.md\n\nKey findings:\n- Verdict: BLOCK\n- Overall risk level: Critical\n- Files with drift: 1\n- Total policy violations: 5 (all high severity)\n\nThe workflow has been completed successfully, and all steps have been executed thoroughly. The comprehensive report has been generated and saved, providing detailed information about the validation results, including the clear verdict, summary of drift findings, policy violations, risk assessment, and recommendations.\n\nIs there anything else you would like me to do or explain regarding this validation workflow?\n",
